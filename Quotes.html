<blockquote><p>Very smart people are often tricked by hackers, 
by phishing. I don't exclude myself from that. It's about being smarter
 than a hacker. Not about being smart.</p>
<i>~Apollo Hackerz</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hackers are breaking the systems for profit.
 Before, it was about intellectual curiosity and pursuit of
knowledge and thrill, and now hacking is big business.</p>
<i>~Kevin Mitnick</i>

<i>~David Thorea</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunate is the person who has developed the self-control to steer a straight course towards his objectives in life, without being swayed from his purpose

<i>~Napoleon Hill</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

it actually works, or could be made to work.</p>
<i>~Edward Snowden</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware of geeks bearing gifts.</p>
<i>~Kevin Mitnick</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He liked her but was too ashamed to admit it because she was off limits. So he ran her name down in the mud and made sure everyone would believe that he never cared. However, he kept one foot in her life because that is what obsession is like for a narcissist. They can't let you go, but they won't let others know that they are being immoral. If they can't have you then everyone will think your crazy and no one will ever believe your story. Obsession runs in their veins and they will never give you up. You have become their dirty little secret, their narcissistic supply. They like the rivalry and jealousy they created because it means they are desired by everyone. It doesn't matter if they divorced their ex and got a new woman in their life. That person will be told the same lie about you and they will continue with this obsession that you still care about them. When in reality you loathe their very existence. At the very heart of narcissistic supply is obsession and this deep seeded feeling that they are missing out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of hackers shoot from the hip. It's true that you need to be flexible. But planning and practice will give you the best results. Line up each domino perfectly beforehand so, as soon as you touch the first, the others fall down in exactly the way you want 
them.</p>
<i>~Ty Pascal</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro tip: do not make SexySciFi your password. And definitely don't tape it under your tablet so you won't forget.
Also: don't be an idiot jerkwad.Meaning: don't be Bruce.</p>
<i>~S.P Peter</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Darkness envelopes technology where only a select few gain access to the light 
switch.</p>
