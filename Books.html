<h2>Ethnic Hacking: Daniel G. Graham</h2>
<p>The parlous state of software and IT infrastructure security is also a career opportunity, 
with malware analysts, security researchers, penetration testers and red teams all in demand. 
Defenders need to know how attackers think, and what tools they use, so they can assess their 
own infrastructure for vulnerabilities and learn to detect malicious activity in the network. 

In Ethical Hacking: A Hands-on Introduction to Breaking In, Daniel G Graham sets
out to deliver a practical guide for learning hacking techniques, and you jump straight into 
the hands-on guide by creating a set of Linux VMs to host the environment you're going to break 
into (since you can't ethically hack someone else's environment). You then work through some known 
vulnerabilities, progressing to
 capturing traffic, building a botnet and a ransomware server, generating phishing emails and
 deepfakes. 

Although you'll need to know how to write and run Python code, 
you don't need a great deal of expertise to get started because the 
step-by-step instructions are clear and detailed. Along the way, complex 
concepts are explained well: if you want to execute ransomware or try to bypass TLS, you need
 to understand encryption first, you need to understand syscalls and the underpinnings of Linux for 
rootkits, and likewise hashing for cracking passwords.

 hacking books but we will recommend you to go for a read of this book as it is 
authored by Kevin Mitnick, he is a well-known hacker and was in the World’s most-wanted 
list of FBI for a long time. This book enlightens the reader about the story of the hacker who

<h2>Black Hat Phython: Justin Seith</h2>

 Hacking is a special type of skill but generally, all hackers prefer to use 
conventional tools like Burp Suite for the purpose of searching various vulnerabilities.

looking onto its loopholes, and for this purpose, Python is the most effective language. As Python
 is very easy to learn, has a very simple syntax, and is so powerful that within only a few lines of 
code you can create a great hacking system. For attaining the power of Python, this book by Justin Seitz 
is one of the highly recommended hacking books. This book is a complete guide that will lead you to create
