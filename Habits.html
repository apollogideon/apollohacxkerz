<p><li><b>We’ve gone short & simple</b><br>They’re easier to remember, 
perhaps, but in terms of data security, a short and simple password is also 
far easier to hack with what are called brute-force attacks – where all possible
 keys or passwords are tried until the correct one is found. The key is build what is
 called ‘entropy’ by choosing passwords with more than eight characters and adding “special 
characters” (such as capital letters, symbols etc). Or better still, a truly random password 
– something that, of course, Dashlane can help you with…
</li></p>
<p><li><b>We let our fingers do the walking</b><br>A recent investigation 
of 15 million accounts by hosting platform WP Engine revealed an odd habit – 
that while many people had seemingly random passwords (such as “qaz2ws” or “adgjmptw”),
 they’d chosen them by typing simple patterns on their keyboards. But beware: password crackers
such as Passpat use keyboard layouts and clever algorithms to measure the likelihood that a password
 is made from a keyboard pattern.
</li></p>
   <p><li><b>We’ve left clues everywhere</b><br>Being sentimental old fools, we’re very likely to create
 passwords from details of our own lives – such as our birthdates, pets, mother’s maiden name, favorite football
 team and so on. However, this leaves us vulnerable to what’s called social engineering, where many of these details 
are also available on social media (e.g. Facebook). This makes it simple for hackers to sift through these biographical
 clues and work out the ‘base phrase’ that you’ve based password on – and then gain access via what is called a dictionary 
attack. Only random words – or, better still, randomly generated alphanumeric sequences – are truly safe enough.
</li></p>
   <p><li><b>We think we’ve been clever</b><br>Many of us attempt to build entropy by 
choosing a simple phrase – and then complicating it by using a combination of upper and lower
 case letters or tran5p05ing numb3r5 f0r l3tt3r5. But analysts found that even supposedly sophisticated 
passwords used obvious base phrases such as “password” or “qwerty” as their base. Which is all hackers need.
 Purpose-built password-breaking software such as HashCat is capable of taking 300,000 guesses at your password a second 
– by taking common base phrases like these and trying obvious variations and permutations.
</li></p>
        <p><li><b>We happily use public WiFi</b><br>Jumping on the free WiFi connection your local coffee shop, 
at the airport or even in your building seems innocuous – but it can leave you vulnerable to a method of hacking known as a 
man-in-the-middle attack. In simple terms, this is a situation where a malicious eavesdropper (the “man in the middle”) is able to read
 (or write) data that is being transmitted between you and the website you’re browsing. Meaning your data, emails and keystrokes could be
 intercepted without you knowing. Eliminate the risk of this by avoiding Wi-Fi connections that aren’t yours and deleting these networks from your 
devices – but also make sure your Wi-Fi connection is secured with a unique, private password.
</li></p>
   <p><li><b>We’ve never deleted our old login emails</b><br>On average, we each now possess more than eighty
 different password-protected accounts – everything from social networking to home deliveries. So it’s understandable
 that many of these login details will still be stored on your main email account in the form of the signup emails you
 were sent when you joined. But what happens if that email is compromised? For the hacker, your email is a goldmine. Services 
like Unroll.me will quickly identify unwanted subscriptions and unsubscribe you from dormant accounts.</li></p>
